RebuildWinJSWeb
===============

Port of the [RebuildWinJS Windows Store app](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/RebuildWinJS) to a web app.

Read the blog post [Convert a Windows Store app to Web in Under 10 Minutes](http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2014/05/convert-windows-store-app-to-web-in.html) for details.

You can also [run the app here](http://jeremylikness.github.io/RebuildWinJSWeb/default.html).

With keyboard, use SPACE to advance slides, BACKSPACE to go to previous slide, and RIGHT ARROW for effects within a specific slide (such as advancing bullets). 

With touch, tap for any in-slide effects and use the buttons at the buttom to navigate between slides.
